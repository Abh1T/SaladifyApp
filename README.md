# SaladifyApp
This project is Saladify. It was a personal project developed to combat food allergies, especially in salads. My cousin has an allergy to walnuts, but she loves salads. This project was made to combat her issue and allow anyone to use a variety of importing functions to use custom FireBase models that would allow them to efficiently see if their allergy could be detected through the use of classifiers. It has an active resizing system developed in XML that allows any device to use it. Unfortunately, some portions of the code were left on my school computer as the pandemic had not allowed me to retrieve those sections. I am still working on this project in my free-time and will push more updates once I get a nice stable release going.
